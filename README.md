This project involves the development and implementation of a simulation environment that leverages machine learning and steering behaviors for autonomous agent goal-seeking. It includes training neural networks, handling datasets, and integrating behavioral logic to achieve desired outcomes.

## Features

- **Simulation Environment**: A customizable environment for training and testing autonomous agents.
- **Neural Networks**: Predefined architectures to model and predict agent behaviors.
- **Goal-Seeking Behavior**: Implements logic for steering agents toward specific goals.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into distinct modules for scalability and reusability.

## File Overview

### Main Scripts

- **`Data_Loaders.py`**: Handles dataset management, including loading and preprocessing.
- **`Helper.py`**: Provides utility functions to support various tasks in the project.
- **`Networks.py`**: Contains the neural network architectures used for training.
- **`SimulationEnvironment.py`**: Defines the environment in which agents operate and interact.
- **`SteeringBehaviors.py`**: Implements steering logic for agent movement and goal-seeking behavior.
